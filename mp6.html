    This video that I created for Mini Project 6, showecases the new seating arrangement in my classroom as well as
    highlights some of the activities that my class has participated in this year. It is my hope that by watching this video,
    viewers will get a sense of my  educational philosophy as well as my teaching style. The first few photographs in the
    slideshow were taken on the first day of school, and allow viewers to see how my classroom looked as students arrived and got situated on the first day.
     Next, the movie progresses into the Classroom Charter that my students and I created together, which focuses on builing a shared vision of the values and respect
    of the classroom. The charter was then signed by all the students, confirming their agreement of the rights of the classroom, which is displayed in the next few slides.

    Moving forward in the slideshow, viewers will see several photos of my students working hard in our school garden. In these images, the students
    were harvesting some of the crops, which were then used in creating different meals in our school cafeteria. The students
    were very proud of the success of the garden and were so excited to harvest their crops! Next are several photographs of
    the "Book Bistro" that studens participated in during our language arts class. Students were required to read a book of their
    choice, and then complete a project with certain requirements. During the, "Book Bistro", students were able to present
    their proejcts to their tablemates and enjoy some yummy refreshments!

    Last in the slideshow are a couple images that were taken from a weekly incentive program called "Worker of the Week".
    Each week, every 5th grade teacher chooses one student from her class that has been showing kindness, hard work and perseverance.
    On Friday, the whole 5th grade gathers together to announce the workers of the week. The students love trying to guess who is going
    to be the "WOW" student, when the teachers are talking about the "mystery students". It is an absolute joy to see how excited
    kids get when they recieve the Worker of the Week award!

     To create this video, I downloaded a program called, Shotcut, which is another video editing tool. I originally
     tried dowloading Windows Movie Maker; however, it appears that Windows stopped providing accessibility to this program earlier this year.
     At first, I had a lot of difficulty understaning how to work this program, but as I kept persevering through the task, it got much easier and more user-friendly.

  To begin the creation of this video, I worked on forming a title page which would include text and music.  I then pieced
  together all of the different images I wanted to use, and worked on adding different transitions in-between frames.
  After all the images had transitions between them, I then worked on creating a credit slide at the end with text. Once
  the movie was completely put together, I went back through the video and finalized different effects. I made sure that the image and music
  faded in and out smoothly at the beginning and end of the video, and worked on making sure the transitions between images were the same length.
