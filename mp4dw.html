            This was my first time using the W3C validator, and I found it to be extremely beneficial. What I love most about this program
            is that it specifies exactly which line there are errors in the coding, which makes it easy to find and correct the mistake. At times debugging was
            definitely frustrating becuase I felt that every time I worked on fixing one error, ten more would arise. In addition, it also took some time
            to understand extactly what the validation errors meant, and what specifically needed to be corrected. Once I started underestanding the langauge of the program, it made it
            easier to fix the mistakes.
            <br />
            <br />
            To begin the process of debugging, I started working on correcting Mini Project 1. As I was validating it, I found some common coding mistakes that I made throughout each of my webpages. My biggest errors in coding was not closing start tags. For instance,
            I would start a paragraph or table tag, and then neglect to close it when I was finished. Although the table or paragraph looked fine when I viewed the page, the coding was actually not correct. When I was validating the pages, I couldn't beleive
            how many unclosed tags that I had disregarded to close! In addition to the closing tags, I was made some coding errors in the table that I made in Mini Project 2. In my code, I said that my table has three columns, but in reality, it only had
            two.
            <br />
            <br />
            Once I had fixed all the errors in the start tags, I decided that I would change the Doctype of all my webpages from CSS to html5. I read a lot about html5 coding is much cleaner than CSS.By changing the Doctype, I was able to really take some time to
            ogranize my work and clean up my code. When I was chahnging from CSS to html5, it took a very long time to recode all of my work, and revalidate it using the W3 validator. I had to learn a lot of new tags and kept making errors in my work. Although
            some of my pages were validated in CSS, they were then not validated in html5 because of the new codes. I had to use a lot of trial and error along with research to make all the pages validated again in html. Although it took some time, I am
            extremely happy with the end result. The coding source pages are so much more crisp and user-friendly, and I love how easy acessible and organized it is!
            <br />
            <br />
            I am very happy that we were able to take these two weeks to validate our webpage because I have learned so much from the process. I now see myself being able to fix errors more quickly, and feel as though I have a much more thorough understanding
            of the coding lanauge. I look forward to becoming even more knowledgable in debugging webpages throughout the reaminder of the course!
