        <p> My name is Sierra Ruiz and I am a 5th grade teacher for the North Olmsted City Schools. This is my seventh year teaching and I absolutely love what I do!
          <br> I couldn't imagine spending my life any other way. I graduated with my Bachelor's Degree in Middle Childhood Education from Ashland University in May 2011.
          <br> I then started pursuing my Master's in Instructional Technology in the summer of 2016 and hope to complete the program in May 2019.</p>

        <p> I currently live in Medina, OH with my husband and our two cats.
          <br> My husband and I met when we were juniors in high school and have been together ever since!
          <br> We celebrated two years of marriage this past summer and plan to start a family sometime in the near future.</p>
        <p> When I am not teaching, I enjoy a variety of different activities including running, cooking and reading.
          <br> Additionally, I enjoy trying traveling and trying new food
