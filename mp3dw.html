    One of the most important parts of teaching is providing ways for every student in the classroom to reach their maximum learning potential. This is done through differentiation, modifications and scaffolding. Over the years, studies have proven that students
    learn best when the information is provided in a manner that fits their individual learning style. Within each lesson, educators should provide opportunities for all learners to access information in a way that works best for them.
  </span>
        </p>

        <p class="style2">
          In the beginning of each school year, every student in our school takes a personal learning inventory. Then, the teachers collect and analyze the data so that we may understand how to adapt our lessons to best fit the students’ needs. After analyzing
          the results from this year, I found out that the majority of my students are auditory and kinesthetic learners. In particular, I have a handful of students who learn best, when they are given a “text to speech” option when reading a text or
          listening to directions.
        </p>

        <p class="style2">
          Over the summer, I took the course, “Web-Based Learning Systems”, where I created a mathematics webquest that I plan to implement with my fifth graders this upcoming semester. Although this is great learning tool, most of the information provided requires
          students to read long segments of information. In order to make this more user-friendly for my group of students, I decided that it would be beneficial to add a “text-to-speech” option for the module overviews and assignment directions. This
          way, the students are still obtaining the information, just in a different manner. For this assignment, I designed a “text-to –speech” option for the enrichment section of my webquest. I first provide the students with the module overview, and
          then moved on to the assignment directions. I plan to continue using Audacity to create the rest of the “text-to-speech” of options for the remaining modules in this webquest.
        </p>

        <p class="style2">
          In order to create the text-to-speech option for my students, I first located some upbeat music from www.pond5.com, that I thought would provide an appropriate transition into the overview of the lesson module. Then, the track was uploaded to Audacity
          and cut to the specific length that I wanted for the introduction. I applied the, “fade in”, effect to the audio as well to provide a smooth progression into track. Once the audio was added, I then recorded the voice overview and directions
          for my students with the Audacity voice recorder. Once the directions were completed, I used the time shift feature to overlap my voice with the opening music when I said, “Enrichment Activities”. This part of the audio was also silenced at
          the beginning to make the voice appear more flawless as it entered the recording.
        </p>

        <p class="style2">
          Next, I added a new voice recording after the “Overview”, to direct my students attention to the “directions” section of my webpage. I wanted their to be a distinction in my voice so that the students knew I was making a transition. In order to create
          a distinction in my voice, I adjusted the volume of the voice recording to make it somewhat quieter. This same process was used in the end of the recording when I explained to the students that the overview and directions were completed. I then
          duplicated the audio from the introduction to add between the first transition, and also found additional audio track to add at the end of the recording. The, “fade in” and “fade out” effects were applied to these tracks and were cut appropriately
          Thereafter, I decreased the clips to to keep the volume waves between 0.5 and -.05 and also mixed all the tracks together. Finally, I went back through the recording and made some final adjustments. I used the “Amplify” effect in the introduction.
          to make my voice stand out against the music and also changed the tempo of the song at the end to make it a little faster. The file was then exported into an MP3 format.
